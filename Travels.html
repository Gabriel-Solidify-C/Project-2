        I've been here time and time again, It's where my mother's parents live and It used to be a nice place way back when, but now there's higher crime rates and the cities are pretty bad but I still enjoy the Scenery.

        There's houses that're just rotting and haven't been torn down, overgrown plants and crops, one-time the water went out too.
